#  NFL: Outcomes of passing plays

## Our mission

The ESPN pug group wants to explore the outcomes of passing plays in the NFL. We gathered data from the NFL Big Bowl Data competition's dataset in Kaggle. Our variable of interest, outcome of play, has many results. Outcomes of plays include touchdown, safety, incomplete pass, fumble, interception, out of bounds, field goal etc. Our dataset gave information on the ball's location at a specific point in the play, the absolute yard line (line of scrimmage), yards to go, down, and direction of play. We used this data to track where the ball was snapped, where the ball was at the end of a play, and to determine outcome of the play.

plot1 <- read.csv("plot1finished.csv")

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For example, you can include **Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text.  For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You should test out updating your GitHub Pages website:

- clone your group's blog project repo in RStudio
- update "Your Project Title Here" to a new title in the YAML header
- knit `index.Rmd` 
- commit and push BOTH the `index.Rmd` and the `index.html` files
- go to <https://stat231-f20.github.io/Blog-ESPN/> to see the published test document (this is a publicly available website!)

## Including code and plots

You can embed code as normal, for example:


Let's clean up the format of that output:


In a study from the 1920s, fifty cars were used to see how the speed of the car and the distance taken to stop were related.  Speeds ranged between `r min(cars$speed)` and `r max(cars$speed)` mph.  Distances taken to stop ranged between `r min(cars$dist)` and `r max(cars$dist)` feet, with the middle 50% falling between `r as.numeric(quantile(cars$dist)[2])` and `r as.numeric(quantile(cars$dist)[4])` feet.  

You can also embed plots as normal, for example:


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Including links and images

You can include [Links](https://www.datadreaming.org/post/r-markdown-theme-gallery/).

You can include images inline with text ![amherst mammoths](https://www.amherst.edu/system/files/styles/original/private/media/Mammoth_Icon_PurpleRGB.png)

or on a new line

# You can even create tabs if you want! {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

## Bulleted list

You can make a bulleted list like this:

- item 1
- item 2
- item 3


## Numbered list

You can make a numbered list like this

1. First thing I want to say
2. Second thing I want to say
